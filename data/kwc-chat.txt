04/12/23, 7:55 pm - +1 (548) 333-5610: ❌❌⚠️⚠️SUNLIFE property management ⚠️⚠️❌❌
Hi guys, the above video is from one of the properties that was leased to us by the SUNLIFE property management in waterloo. Im sending this message to you guys not to fall in their scam. They have not done any kind of maintenance so far, this video is one of the few incidents that happened to us from them. They told us that the house was nice and fully maintained, but that was not the case, and the pictures that we saw were completely different. When we changed our contract from them, they were reluctant to give us back the security deposit, but now its 1650 dollars. They are mainly targeting those who are new to canada, mostly international students. Please share this with everyone. Please beware of this housing agency SUNLIFE.

12/01/24, 5:20 pm - +1 (548) 333-3381: Subject: Justice for Saandra - Let's never forget this tragedy caused by medical negligence.
It is with great sadness that we report the passing of Saandra Salim, a cherished member of our community, who endured months of suffering following a series of medical oversights.
Saandra, a 25-year-old international student full of life and dreams, sought medical attention at Grand River Hospital in November 2022 for severe abdominal pain. A sizable pelvic mass was diagnosed, leading to surgery on November 22, 2022. Unfortunately, the nature of the tumor remained unknown upon discharge, with assurances from the medical team that they would contact Saandra once the pathology reports were available. Regrettably, no such communication transpired despite her persistent attempts to reach out.
In June 2023, Saandra returned to Grand River Hospital complaining of lower back pain. Surprisingly, she was only prescribed Tylenol, and there was no follow-up, even though her surgical history was documented in her file. Her subsequent visit in July 2023, prompted by her inability to stand on both legs, revealed a devastating diagnosis in August — a widely metastatic gynecologic tumor that had spread to her liver, spine, and uterus. Shockingly, she was verbally informed that she had approximately three months left.
In her unwavering spirit, Saandra battled the illness for a month in Canada before returning to Kerala, India, seeking better medical care. Tragically, Saandra, a vibrant dancer with an exceptionally positive attitude towards life, had to stop her fight with cancer on 11/01/2024.
This heartbreaking incident highlights the need for a thorough investigation into the medical care Saandra received at Grand River Hospital. Our community mourns the loss of a vibrant soul, and we hope that no one else will have to endure such negligence in the future.
As a community deeply affected by this heartbreaking incident, we recognize the need to take a stand and advocate for justice. In light of this, we propose organizing a peaceful protest to demand justice for Saandra and to raise awareness among the public and healthcare professionals. It is our collective responsibility to prevent such occurrences in the future and ensure that every individual receives the care and attention they deserve.
We appreciate your support in this endeavor and will keep you updated on the details of the protest. Together, let us strive for a healthcare system that prioritizes the well-being and safety of every individual.
Let us know if you can join us during the peaceful protest that we are planning to conduct on Sunday Morning 11:30 A.M  in front of Grand RiverHospital, Kitchener.
Please contact us in 226-606-6304 (Sooraj Athippatta) 647-673-0930 (Amritha Stalin)  416-605-7113 (Rajeev Pillai)
 and 416-886-0430 (Pradeep Chenampallil) if you require more information.

Sincerely,
Sooraj Athippatta
